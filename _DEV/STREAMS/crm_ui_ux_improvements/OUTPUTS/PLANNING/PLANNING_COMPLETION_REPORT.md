## Key Planning Decisions

### 1. Phase Structure
- **Decision:** 4 phases (Foundation → Visualizations → Advanced → Polish)
- **Rationale:** Logical progression, foundation first, advanced features later

### 2. Parallel Work
- **Decision:** Enable parallel work where possible
- **Rationale:** Reduce total timeline, optimize resource utilization

### 3. Critical Path
- **Decision:** Dashboard system is critical path
- **Rationale:** Foundation for other features, longest dependency chain

### 4. Risk Mitigation
- **Decision:** Early start on complex features, use proven libraries
- **Rationale:** Reduce risk of delays, leverage existing solutions
