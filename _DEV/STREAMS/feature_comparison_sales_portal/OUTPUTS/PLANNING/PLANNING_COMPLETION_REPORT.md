## Key Planning Decisions

### Strategic Decisions

1. **3-Phase Approach**
   - P0 features first (critical)
   - P1 features second (important)
   - P2 features third (optional)

2. **Parallel Work Strategy**
   - Services built in parallel
   - UI components built in parallel
   - Integration done in parallel
   - 30-40% time reduction

3. **Foundation-First Approach**
   - Services before components
   - Components before integration
   - Test after each phase

4. **Modular Architecture**
   - Services for business logic
   - Components for UI
   - Clear separation of concerns

---
