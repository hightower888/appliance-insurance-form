## Complexity Calculation

| Component | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| File Score | 10/60 |
| Characteristics Score | 25/40 |
| **Final Score** | **35/100** |

**Complexity Category:** Simple
**Recommended Discovery Mode:** QUICK (3 steps)
**Confidence:** Medium

**Rationale:**
- File structure is minimal (~9-12 source files)
- However, features are complex (5 major features)
- Database schema changes required
- Multiple new systems (dynamic forms, processor role, CSV mapping)
- But overall scope is manageable as enhancement to existing system

**Drift Check:**
- Original intent: Enhance appliance insurance form with dynamic field management, processor role, CSV field mapping, enhanced admin table with search/filter/sort
- Routing aligns with intent: ✅ Yes
- Alignment score: 0.85 (threshold: 0.8)
- Status: ✅ PASS

**Note:** While the feature set is complex, the project structure is simple and this is an enhancement to an existing system, making QUICK discovery appropriate.
