## Key Planning Decisions

### 1. Phase Structure
**Decision:** Split Phase 4 into 3 sub-phases (4A, 4B, 4C)  
**Rationale:** Logical grouping, clear milestones, manageable chunks

### 2. Priority Assignment
**Decision:** P0 for Performance & Mobile, P1 for Analytics & Automation, P1-P2 for Polish  
**Rationale:** Performance and mobile are critical for user base, analytics provides competitive advantage

### 3. Duration Estimate
**Decision:** 9 weeks sequential, 6-7 weeks with parallel work  
**Rationale:** Realistic estimates based on task complexity and dependencies

### 4. Risk Mitigation
**Decision:** Identify high-risk areas and mitigation strategies  
**Rationale:** Proactive risk management for complex features
