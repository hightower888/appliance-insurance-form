# Vercel Access - Direct Instructions for Developer

**Developer Email:** kennen_02@icloud.com  
**Team:** Dan-Ai-Mate  
**Status:** Invitation sent (may be delayed or in spam)

---

## Option 1: Check Email (Including Spam)

1. Check inbox for email from **Vercel** or **noreply@vercel.com**
2. **Check spam/junk folder** - Vercel emails sometimes go there
3. Check email filters - iCloud may have filtered it
4. Look for subject: "You've been invited to join Dan-Ai-Mate on Vercel"

---

## Option 2: Direct Dashboard Access (Recommended)

If email doesn't arrive, you can access directly:

### Step 1: Create/Login to Vercel Account
1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/signup**
2. Sign up with: `kennen_02@icloud.com`
3. Or login if you already have an account

### Step 2: Access Team Directly
1. After login, go to: **https://vercel.com/teams/dan-ai-mate**
2. You should see the team if invitation is pending
3. Or request access if needed

### Step 3: Alternative - Direct Project Link
1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/dan-ai-mate/appliance-cover-form**
2. This should show the project (may prompt for access)

---

## Option 3: Manual Team Invitation (If Needed)

If the above doesn't work, the admin can manually add you:

1. Admin goes to: **https://vercel.com/teams/dan-ai-mate/settings/members**
2. Click **"Invite Member"**
3. Enter: `kennen_02@icloud.com`
4. Select role: **Owner** or **Admin**
5. Send invitation

---

## Option 4: Direct Project Access

You can also try accessing the project directly:

**Project URL:** https://vercel.com/dan-ai-mate/appliance-cover-form

If you get "Access Denied", it means the invitation hasn't been accepted yet.

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received?
- ✅ **Check spam folder** (most common issue)
- ✅ **Wait 5-10 minutes** (email delivery delay)
- ✅ **Check email filters** (iCloud may have filtered it)
- ✅ **Try direct dashboard access** (Option 2 above)

### Already Have Vercel Account?
- If you already have a Vercel account with a different email, you may need to:
  1. Add `kennen_02@icloud.com` as an email to your account
  2. Or accept invitation with that email

### Need to Resend Invitation?
- Admin can resend via dashboard or CLI:
  ```bash
  vercel teams invite kennen_02@icloud.com --scope=dan-ai-mate
  ```
